## Cross-Platform Compatibility, Ease of Use and Ease of Access Key

### Cross-Platform Compatibility 游린游릲游릳游릴游릱游릵游릶

Web-Based means a program is meant to be run in a web-browser essentially making it cross-compatible with all devices (mobile and desktop). This doesn't guarentee the experience will be pleasent (e.g. video editing on a mobile phone), but means the experience is possible.

Platform-Agnostic means a program that is compatible with one operating system is compatible with all listed operating systems. This does not mean it is designed to work across both desktop and mobile environments, only that it can run on multiple operating systems within the same category.

Common Platform-Agnostic means a program is support on Windows and Mac.

Apple Platform-Unified indicates a program is specific to Apple products, but is cross-platform between macOS and iOS.

Platform-Specific means a program is specific to one platform (e.g. an app that can only be installed on Androids)
