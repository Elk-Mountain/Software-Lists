# Academic Resources and Tools

This is a collection of resources and tools I use and recommend to faculty in a higher-ed environment. I'll log any new tools I come across.

## Platform Definitions:

Web-Based:

Tools labelled "Web-Based" are designed to be used in your computers web browser or on your mobile phones browser (may not be ideal). Most advanced online tools require at minimum WebGL support.

Here is a list of common web-browsers.

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Microsoft Edge
- Opera/Opera GX
- Brave

Desktop Operating Systems: 

Here is a list of common operating systems for desktop computers.

- Windows 10/11
- macOS
- Linux

Mobile: 

- Android
- iOS

## Cross-Platform Compatibility, Ease of Use and Ease of Access Key

If a color square is missing it is either because I haven't used the tool or I haven't added a square yet.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility 

Web-Based means a program is meant to be run in a web-browser essentially making it cross-compatible with all devices (mobile and desktop). This doesn't guarentee the experience will be pleasent (e.g. video editing on a mobile phone), but means the experience is possible.

Platform-Agnostic means a program that is compatible with one operating system is compatible with all listed operating systems. This does not mean it is designed to work across both desktop and mobile environments, only that it can run on multiple operating systems within the same category.

Common Platform-Agnostic means a program is support on Windows and Mac.

Apple Platform-Unified indicates a program is specific to Apple products, but is cross-platform between macOS and iOS.

Platform-Specific means a program is specific to one platform (e.g. an app that can only be installed on Androids)

Web-Based: 游릱<br />
Platform-Agnostic: 游릴<br />
Common Platform-Agnostic:游릳<br />
Apple Platform-Unified: 游릲<br />
Platform-Specific:游린<br />

Somewhat Difficult: 游릳<br />
Not Recommended for Beginners: 游릲<br />
Professional Tool: 游린<br />

### Ease of Access

Ease of Access specifices what's require to download and use a program.
